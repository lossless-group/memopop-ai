# Context
At this point our agency, The Lossless Group, has dozens of projects and a few clients, and a loose group of people who are developing, designing, and publishing content.  

We are using Obsidian as our content management tool, and we are using AI assistants to help us with our content creation and management.  

We are using a monorepo to manage our codebase, and we are using a few different tools to help us with our code generation and management.  

Because Astro uses a `collections` paradigm, it's very helpful to have a consistent way to format frontmatter YAML per collection.  

This is **exponentially true** with Changelogs, as we will attempt to have a centralized agency changelog that aggregates changes from all of our projects and clients.  In addition to the frontmatter, we have two sections that need to come first: the summary and the `Why Care?` section.

For the changelog content, we prefer rigorous explanations, with architectural diagrams in either Mermaid or Ascii. We expect robust code samples that shows how the system works, or how the codebase or functionality will be affected. It's written in part for our own team, part for our clients, and part to attract potential clients and collaborators who might find that we have worked through something they are working through and be `impressed` with our technical depth and problem-solving approach.

## Model YAML Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "Fix Astro/Vercel Production Deployment Issues for Static Assets" # 
date: 2025-04-28 # User Generated. Date of the change commitment and/or completion
authors: 
- Michael Staton # Primary human collaborator/author
augmented_with: "ChatGPT 4o" # System Generated (AI Assistant). The IDE, AI Assistant, or other tool that generated the change. ie. Windsurf on GPT5.1, Claude Code on Opus 4.5.
category: "Technical-Changes" # Not exactly an enum, but should converge on a few broad categories that make searching and filtering easy and meaningful to both developers and readers.
date_created: 2025-04-27 # System Generated (Obsidian/AI Assistant). Date of the change creation
date_modified: 2025-04-30 # System Generated (Obsidian/AI Assistant). Date of the most recent document modification. This should be updated automatically by the system.
tags: # Some attempt should be made to converge on consistent tag use for later search, filtering, sorting, and grouping.  But should be descriptive and meaningful to both developers and readers. All tags must have the convention of Train-Case for use of Obsidian as content management tool.

## Model Summary and Why Care:
```markdown
# Summary
Resolved production 500 errors on Vercel by fixing undated/nonexistent icons in the @tabler library as well as conflicting folders assets/Icons and assets/icons. Also removed legacy callouts code that is no longer in use.

***

## Why Care
Without fixing the asset management system, Astro builds worked locally but crashed with Internal Server Errors on Vercel. Correcting the public asset handling ensures production stability and faster page load times without serverless crashes.
